		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 05-10-2024</p>

		<p>Welcome to transcendence! We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This
			Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and store your personal information when you use our services,
			including playing games and interacting with other users. It also outlines your rights under the General
			Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

		<h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
		<p>transcendence ("we," "our," "us") operates a web application that allows users to play the Pong game and
			interact with other users. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how your data is handled,
			you can contact us at:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Email:</strong> sgodin@student.s19.be</li>
			<li><strong>Data Controller:</strong> transcendence</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
		<p>We collect the following personal information when you register on our platform:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>First Name</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Last Name</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Username</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Email Address</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Password</strong> (encrypted for security)</li>
			<li><strong>Avatar</strong> (optional upload)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
		<p>We use your personal data to provide and improve the services on our platform, including allowing you to play
			games, interact with other users, and manage your account.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Registration and Account Management:</strong> We use your name, username, and email to create
				and manage your account.</li>
			<li><strong>Avatar Upload:</strong> If you upload an avatar, it will be stored in our database and displayed
				on your profile and in games.</li>
			<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> We store your gameplay information, such as win/loss history, scores, and
				other game statistics. No personal information is stored in game historyâ€”only gameplay details like your
				score and results.</li>
			<li><strong>Private Messaging:</strong> You can communicate with other users via private chat. Messages are
				stored in our database to facilitate conversations, but they are deleted permanently when you delete
				your account.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>4. Data Retention and Account Deletion</h2>
		<p><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You have the right to delete your account at any time. When you delete
			your account, we will:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Permanently erase your personal data (name, last name, email, avatar, and messages).</li>
			<li>Anonymize your gameplay history by replacing your username with "Deleted User" or similar, so that game
				statistics like scores remain but are no longer associated with you.</li>
			<li>Remove all private messages you have exchanged with other users.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Once deleted, this action is irreversible, and we will not be able to recover your account or any personal
			data.</p>

		<h2>5. How We Store and Protect Your Data</h2>
		<p>We take security seriously and have implemented measures to protect your personal data. Your password is
			encrypted, and all other personal data is stored securely in our database. We regularly update our security
			practices to ensure your data is safe.</p>

		<h2>6. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
		<p>The only cookies we use are for purposes such as storing tokens and user IDs.</p>

		<h2>7. Your Rights Under GDPR</h2>
		<p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can request access to the personal data we hold about you.</li>
			<li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You can correct any inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
			<li><strong>Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):</strong> You can request the deletion of your personal
				data, and we will comply, as explained above.</li>
			<li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You can ask us to stop processing your data under certain
				circumstances.</li>
			<li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You can request a copy of your personal data in a
				structured, machine-readable format.</li>
			<li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You can object to the processing of your personal data under certain
				conditions.</li>
			<li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> If we process your data based on consent (such as for
				optional features), you can withdraw that consent at any time.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To exercise any of these rights, you can contact us at <a
				href="mailto:sgodin@student.s19.be">sgodin@student.s19.be</a>.</p>

			requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the date of the last update will be indicated at
			the top.</p>
